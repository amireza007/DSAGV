# DSAGV
This repo is associated with the project developed by Prof. Rashidi (Allameh Tabatabai University) and Prof. Tsang (Essex University) in early 2000s. 
We aim to update the source codes and fix bugs so that it is suitable for newer operating systems.

HCDVRP.cpp is the Job Generator. This and the MCFModel.cpp are the hugest files (more than 1000 and 2500 line, respectively!)
The program uses borland database engine (bde), which is old according to Embarcadero Co.
Source codes containing objects of other classes in another cpp file have the following pattern: NAMEOFTHECPPform->DATAMEMBER->... NAMEOFTHECPP.cpp is the file you may wanna look in the directory.
Still confused about the presence of Delphi files (.dfm). Delphi is a progamming language mostly used for UI stuff...
